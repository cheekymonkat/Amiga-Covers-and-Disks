Amiga Game Covers and Disks
===========================

Here I present a selection of covers and disk to print.

Please see my blog: https://nowandthentech.wordpress.com/ for details.

Covers:

The Covers are for the EZDraw application on the Mac.  The free version is perfectly fine BUT you must add the font
included with this download (Called Graduate).  This is to ensure the Cover fonts are displayed correctly.

If you require a PDF version then this can be provided on request.

Disks:

The disk labels were generated on http://www.avery.com/avery/en_us/

Simply create an account, go to 'print yourself' and then upload them as a new project.  See the blog for more details.
